Repositories that are worth reading with a little information as to why they're worth reading. They might be fun projects that are well written or one file programs that every beginner looks for. Some repositories may be well suited as a gentle introduction to some important concepts or paradigms in computer science. It's quite difficult to find good code in a specific area of your interest among the millions of repositories available online. Feel free to contribute.
