Relevant, clean or fun code is difficult to find. It gets burried among the millions of repositories that can be found online. It becomes a herculean task if you want to find code in a particular language or a in a particular domain. This is an attempt to solve this particular problem. Many a times upon finding a repository that interests me, I find many more repositories that are relevant to me that are maintained by the same author.  

One or more of the following sentences describe the repositories mentioned here.  
- Elegant and well written. Also may be a classic example of code in that language / domain.  
	This may give people the opportunity to read code and help them in their journey of writing better code.
- Cool ideas with execution. May or may not be well written.
	At times people aren't aware of the capabilities of the language they program in. Also shiny stuff has the tendency to keep people motivated and fosters learning. Osmosis may also result in new ideas of their own.
- Baby steps. Something elegant and usable but not complex. Beginner's delight.
	Most tutorials online teach trivial stuff. It becomes difficult to connect the dots and actually see what they lead to. However there are some inviting repositories that are savvy enough to do interesting stuff and at the same time aren't very difficult to grok.
- Domain intensive.
	You're interested in games written in C++ or coding your own dummy operating system or a programming language? There are quite repositories written to complete college assignments or for fun.
